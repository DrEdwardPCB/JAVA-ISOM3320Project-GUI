# JAVA-ISOM3320-GUI

This project is a homework for my girlfriend university course ISOM3320. In this project there are a total of 3 contributors. However due to internal reason, there is an argument between me and one of the contributor, Due to the following facts, this project is therefore owned by me now and I decide to remove the contributor and open source this project.

---

1. I create this repository
2. At least 60% of code are originate from me
3. The removed contributor is major in Computer Science(CS) who is the only one able to code effectively in the project team , yet he is a deadline fighter.As my girlfriend was worrying about this project leaving me no choice to start writing this project before that contributor start even I did not take this ISOM3320 course and not majoring in CS.
4. The course has ended and both me and my girlfriend has graduated(the removed contributor hasn't graduate yet by the time I commit this readme.md)
